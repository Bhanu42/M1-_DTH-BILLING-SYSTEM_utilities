## Introduction
•	Searching for a book in a real large library is a very tedious process and keeping manual method of tracking book transactions is even more tedious. So through this program I have come up with a solution which can ease these tasks by implementing a “C program” using the linked lists Data Structures. This program is able to keep track of the book transactions in the library. We begin with adding books of different genre to the corresponding genre. In this program we as a user can perform adding, borrowing and returning of the books and more importantly displaying the information of the books in the library.

•	The library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.
